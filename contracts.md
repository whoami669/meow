# OCE Live Link-Up - Frontend/Backend Integration Contracts

## Overview
This document outlines the integration contracts between the frontend React application and any potential backend services for the OCE Live Link-Up Discord landing page.

## Current Implementation Status
- **Frontend**: ✅ Complete static implementation with JSON data structure
- **Backend**: ❌ Not required for current functionality
- **Database**: ❌ Not needed for static landing page

## Data Structure (Currently in /src/data/content.json)

### Mock Data Locations:
- **Site Configuration**: `content.site` - Basic site info and Discord invite link
- **Hero Content**: `content.hero` - Main hero section with badges
- **Mission Values**: `content.mission.values` - Three core values with icons
- **Safety Charter**: `content.safetyCharter` - Rules and workflow
- **Channel Directory**: `content.channels.categories` - Complete server channel map
- **Creator Hub**: `content.creatorHub.features` - Creator support features
- **Founder Letter**: `content.founderLetter` - Raul's message and content
- **Roadmap**: `content.roadmap.phases` - Development phases and timeline
- **Roles System**: `content.roles` - Self-assign role categories and steps
- **FAQ**: `content.faq.items` - Frequently asked questions

## Static Site Architecture

### Current Setup:
- ✅ All content managed through JSON files in `/src/data/`
- ✅ No external API calls required
- ✅ Discord integration via external link only
- ✅ Fully functional without backend

### Future Enhancement Options:
1. **Content Management**: Replace JSON with headless CMS (Contentful/Notion)
2. **Discord Widget**: Add optional Discord server widget component
3. **Analytics**: Add visit tracking (currently intentionally excluded)
4. **Form Handling**: Add contact forms if needed later

## API Contracts (If Backend Added Later)

### Potential Endpoints:
```
GET /api/content/site - Site configuration
GET /api/content/hero - Hero section data  
GET /api/content/mission - Mission and values
GET /api/content/safety - Safety charter rules
GET /api/content/channels - Channel directory
GET /api/content/roadmap - Development roadmap
GET /api/content/faq - FAQ items
```

### Discord Integration:
- **Current**: Static link to `https://discord.gg/uTJ95jVq`
- **Future**: Optional Discord widget with server stats
- **Implementation**: Lazy-loaded iframe component (disabled by default)

## Frontend Features Requiring No Backend:
- ✅ Responsive navigation with smooth scrolling
- ✅ Animated hero section with gradient text
- ✅ Interactive sections with hover effects
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Glassmorphism and neon effects
- ✅ FAQ accordion functionality
- ✅ Channel directory with expandable categories
- ✅ Roadmap with progress indicators
- ✅ Footer with quick links

## Deployment Notes:
- **Type**: Static site deployment (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, Vercel)
- **Build**: Standard React build process
- **Assets**: All images and content self-contained
- **External Dependencies**: Google Fonts, Discord invite link only

## Integration Status: ✅ COMPLETE
The landing page is fully functional as a static site with no backend requirements. All interactivity is client-side only, with content managed through easily editable JSON files.
